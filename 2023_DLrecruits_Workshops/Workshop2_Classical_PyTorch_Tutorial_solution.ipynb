That's because by itself, the RGB values of the raw data have differing ranges. the blue pixel may have a range of of 0->125 while the red pixel may have a range of 120->245. This different range often causes headaches for the optimizer and it takes the gradient descent to converge much slowly as it has to cater to the differing conditions of both the red and blue pixel.\n",
